            <h3 id="aboutMe_desc"> I am a web developer based in Paris, France.
                Born on April 13th, 2000, I have always been passionate about programming and technology,
                 which led me to pursue a career in this field. I received my training in web development,
                  including JS, HTML, and CSS, through a comprehensive program in a foreign country, which helped 
                  me gain the necessary skills and knowledge to become proficient in these areas.

               As a programmer, I am dedicated to producing high-quality work that meets the needs of my
               
               clients and users. I am comfortable working both independently and as part of a team, and 
               I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages to stay up-to-date with
                the latest trends and best practices.
               
               I am passionate about using my skills to create meaningful and impactful web applications 
               that can make a difference in people's lives. Whether it's developing a new website, improving
                an existing one, or creating custom solutions to meet specific needs, I am committed to delivering 
                results that exceed expectations.
               
               Thank you for taking the time to read this introduction, and I look forward to discussing 
               any potential opportunities or projects with you in the future.</h3>
